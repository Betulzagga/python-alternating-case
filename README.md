## Alternating String Case with Enumerate

This Python script demonstrates a simple use of the `enumerate()` function to alternate the casing of characters in a string: even-indexed characters remain lowercase, while odd-indexed characters are converted to uppercase.

It can serve as a beginner-level exercise in string manipulation, indexing, and control flow, and is sometimes used as a warm-up question in technical interviews.
